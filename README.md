## **Additional Information**
Issue with Negative Magnitude Values in Radius Calculation

In the project, the radius of each earthquake marker is determined by the formula `Math.sqrt(feature.properties.mag) * 6`. However, the `Math.sqrt` function in JavaScript returns `NaN` (Not-a-Number) if the input is a negative number. 

This caused issues when the magnitude (`feature.properties.mag`) had negative values, resulting in an invalid radius (i.e., `NaN`), which prevented the marker from being rendered correctly.<br>
If radius was just set to a fixed value, making all circles the same radius this was not an issue. Unfortunately attempting to make the circles vary according to distance below ground, the few earthquakes that did happen above ground, caused the Math.sqrt to error. 

### Solution:

To address this, a check was added to ensure that the radius is valid. If the radius is `NaN` or less than or equal to `0`, it is set to `0` to prevent rendering errors:

```javascript
if (isNaN(radius) || radius <= 0) {
  radius = 0;
  console.log("Setting radius to 0 due to invalid value");
}
```
